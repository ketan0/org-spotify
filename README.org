#+TITLE: org-spotify

org-spotify aims to bring Spotify to the plain-text medium (albeit in a barebones way.) You can create org-mode links that will automatically play spotify tracks, albums, etc., and organize those into playlists.

* Installation
This package is not yet available on MELPA. However, using straight.el and use-package to install this package is fairly straightforward:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-spotify
  :straight (:host github :repo "ketan0/org-spotify"))
#+end_src

Otherwise, you can simply clone this repo, and drop it in your load path like so:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-spotify")
(require 'org-spotify)
#+end_src

* Setup
You'll need to follow the instructions to configure ~counsel-spotify~ here: https://github.com/Lautaro-Garcia/counsel-spotify#notes-on-spotify-web-api-authentication

Additionally, set ~org-spotify-user-id~ to your Spotify username.
* Usage
** Creating a Spotify link
You can call any of the following interactive commands to search for content on spotify and insert "Spotify links" that, when clicked, will play the appropriate music:
- =org-spotify-insert=
- =org-spotify-insert-artist=
- =org-spotify-insert-album=
- =org-spotify-insert-track=
- =org-spotify-insert-playlist=
** Creating + maintaining Spotify playlists
With your cursor on a headline which contains some tracks below it, call ~org-spotify-push-playlist-at-point~.

[TODO: screenshot/gif demonstrating]
** (experimental) Playing Spotify music upon entering a file
Call =org-spotify-set-file-href= interactively to specify a Spotify URI to be played when the current file is opened. (Just for fun. The idea is that you could associate certain songs/audio with certain notes, and thus evoke certain memories about that note...)
* Planned future features
** Organize your songs into "playgraphs" (as an extension of mere playlists)
